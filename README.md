# Text-SQLLLMUsingOpenAIAndAWS
<H2><B> Title </B></H2> Build and Deploy Text-2-SQL LLM Using OpenAI and AWS

<H2><B> Description </B></H2> The aim of the SQLGenPro project is to develop a Streamlit-based web application that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries into optimized SQL commands, enabling secure database interaction, user authentication, and seamless deployment on AWS.

<H2><B> Approach </B></H2>
<br>
1. LLM Integration and Database Interaction:
<br>
● Integrate the LLM via API to convert natural language queries into SQL. 
<br>
● Develop backend modules to execute SQL queries on Databricks/Snowflake and
retrieve results.
<br>
● Implement error handling to manage SQL generation and execution issues.
<br>
2. Prompt Engineering and SQL Optimization:
<br>
● Create and refine prompt templates to accurately generate SQL, including
complex queries (CTEs, joins).
<br>
● Implement SQL validation and optimization to ensure generated queries are
efficient and correct.
<br>
3. Deployment:
<br>
● Configure and deploy the application on AWS EC2 with HTTPS for secure
access and scalable performance.
